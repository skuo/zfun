# screen capture
To capture a specific application window, press Command-Shift-4, then
press the Spacebar. The cursor will change to a camera, and you can
move it around the screen. As you move the cursor over an application
window, the window will be highlighted. The entire window does not
need to be visible for you to capture it. When you have the cursor
over a window you want to capture, just click the mouse button and the
screen shot will be saved as a PNG file on your desktop. (The file is
saved as PDF in Mac OS 10.3 and earlier.)
